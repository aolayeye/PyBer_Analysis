# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This analysis seeks to the data of PyBer, a Python-based ride sharing app company. Our goal is to perform exploratory data analysis on large dataset to determine the relationship between the type of ciity and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. To achieve this goal, We would create several visualizations, write python scripts using pandas library and matplotlib to create a variety of charts in the end, we hope to use the analysis and visulaizations we produce to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. 

### Control Flow
1. Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Inspect the data to dertermine the shape of the data, what types of columns are present, and if the data is readable or needs to be converted in some way.
3. Merge your DataFrames.
4. Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
5. Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
    - The total number of rides for each city type.
    - The average fares for each city type.
    - The total number of drivers for each city type.
6. Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
    - The number of rides for each city type.
    - The fares for each city type.
    - The number of drivers for each city type.
7. Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
    - The percent of total fares.
    - The percent of total rides.
    - The percent of total drivers.
